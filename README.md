# Raccoon-Onboarding_Project
## Onboarding project 2. To align the personal code skills with company practices.

Project developed during the onboarding fase of my internship with Raccoon Marketing Digital (raccoon.monks).  
Applied all the concepts of a basic but complete project to align my personal coding style with the company's coding style.  
Project developed using the "Mobile-First" concept with html, pure css and all the functionality was developed with vanilla javascript.  
Features like: Modal, Accordion, Carousel, etc.  
Completely responsive.
